# Localized WinForms

## Overview

### Introduction

To my surprise, I found difficult to get a decent explanation and code examples on how to localize (make multilingual) a Window Forms application.

After hours of research and tests, I found a way to do that and will share it here.

### Features

This is a dumb empty WinForms that has these characteristics:

- Started from the Windows Forms App template
- .NET Framework 4.7.2, with C# language
- Simple Form with:
  - a Main form
  - a ComboBox to switch language
  - a Quit button that will adapt to the language

- When changing the language, the UI changes its display

  - English UI (Default):


  - Switch Language with ComboBox:


  - French UI:


### Prerequisites


### Disclaimer

This code is delivered "as-is". It lacks many production features and recommended patterns, like Unit Testing, Dependency Injection, Factory, Logging, etc.

It just focuses on getting the Language UI to change.

And, of course, can be greatly improved and complexified.

## Steps-by-steps

### 1. Create the project

    !["Template selection](/media/10_CreateProjectSolution.png)

    <!-- !["Start point"](/media/20_NewProject_result.png) -->

### 2. Adapt your UI

  - Make the Form smaller

  - Add a Button (from Toolbox, drag-n-drop):

      !["Add button"](/media/30_AddButton.png)

  - Add a ComboBox (from Toolbox):

      !["Add ComboBox"](/media/40_AddComboBox.png)

    Result so far:

    !["Form1"](/media/50_Form1.png)

### 3. Setup the ComboBox

The ComboBox content can be managed in 2 ways:

  1. As an Items `Collection` directly in the ComboBox object

  2. As a DataBinding to an external source

The `Option 1` is easy and when you understand how ComboBox operates, you can easily manipulate the [ComboBox.Items](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.combobox.items?view=windowsdesktop-7.0) and [ComboBox.SelectedIndex](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.combobox.selectedindex?view=windowsdesktop-7.0) properties with code.

When we switch the UI language, the entire form (and its sub-objects) are re-created and re-initialized. This needs to be considered in terms of choice.

For more flexibility, I decided to use `Option 2` / DataBinding for these 2 main reasons:

  1. It gives control on the `Language` object properties and avoid "hard-coded" tests on locale in the code (see below),

  2. I can change the binding in the dropdown, so when in French UI, the ComboBox items can be bound to a `French` language list (nice to have nugget - but could also be done with `Option 1`).

#### ComboBox Items

- Create a folder `Classes` and a class `Lang` (so we don't conflict with the Built-in Class):

  ```C#
  namespace WindowsFormsApp1.Classes
  {
      internal class Lang
      {
          public int Index { get; }
          public string Name { get; }
          public string Code { get; }

          public Lang(int index, string name, string code)
          {
              Index = index;
              Name = name;
              Code = code;
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  Remarks:
  - It appears an `integer` is required for the ComboBox to function. It is used as the `Index` by the ComboBox,
  - `Name` property will be set to be what is displayed in the Form,
  - `Code` will allow us to switch the Thread Culture in a secure manner.

- Open `Form1.cs`. It should contain only this:

    ```C#
    namespace WindowsFormsApp1
    {
        public partial class Form1 : Form
        {
            public Form1()
            {
                InitializeComponent();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- Add code to it to gather the Languages values:

  - 1 private member of type `IDictionary<string, Lang[]>` that will store the `LanguagesCollections` used by the ComboBox,

  - 1 private method that will populate the `LanguagesCollections`. Here we will hard-code, but it can come from any source,

  - Add the method the method to be executed in `Form1()` constructor. It binds the member to the Form1 lifecycle.

  It gives:

  ```C#
  public Form1()
  {
      InitializeComponent();
      GetLanguagesCollections();
  }

  private IDictionary<string, Lang[]> _languages;

  private void GetLanguagesCollections()
  {
      //These are hard-coded here, but could be pulled from any settings source, Dependency Injected, and set as global constants for the entire App, if more than 1 Win Form is used.
      _languages = new Dictionary<string, Lang[]>
      {
          {
              "en-US",
              new[]
      {
          new Lang(0, "English", "en-US"),
          new Lang(1, "French", "fr-FR"),
      }
          },
          {
              "fr-FR",
              new[]
      {
          new Lang(0, "Anglais", "en-US"),
          new Lang(1, "Fran√ßais", "fr-FR"),
      }
          }
      };
  }
  ```

  Remarks:
  - I used `Array` instead of a `List<Language>` because it is pretty static in nature.
  - The use of a `IDictionary<string, Language[]>` will allow to make all code generic.

- Add code to `Form1.cs` to bind the Languages values to the ComboBox:

  ```C#
  private void SetComboBoxItemsLanguage(string lang)
  {
      comboBox1.DataSource = _languages[lang];
      comboBox1.DisplayMember = "Name";
      comboBox1.ValueMember = "Code";
      var index = Array.Find(_languages[lang], element => element.Code == lang).Index;
      comboBox1.SelectedIndex = index;
  }
  ```

- Generate code for the `Form1_Load` event:

  - Go to the tab `Form1.cs [Design]`

  - Check the entire `Form1` is selected

  - Switch from `Properties` to `Events`:
  
    !["Switch to Events"](/media//60_SwitchToEvents.png)

  - Double-Click in the `Load` event

    !["DoubleClick Load"](/media/70_FormLoad.png)

  - Check you are in the `Form1_Load` event code:

    !["Form1_Load event code"](/media/80_FormLoad_method.png)

  - Add this command to the event:

    ```C#
    private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
      SetComboBoxItemsLanguage(_languages.First().Key);
    }
    ```
  Now, the ComboBox can load the languages items and change them depending of the requested language.

#### ComboBox Items change to the selected Language

  - Go to the tab `Form1.cs [Design]`

  - Click on the `comboBox1` to select it

  - Switch from `Properties` to `Events`:

  - Double click in `SelectionChangeCommitted` event to create the event's code:

    !["SelectionChangeCommitted"](/media/90_comboBox1_ChangeCommitted.png)

    !["event code"](/media/100_changeCommitted_event_code.png)

  - Add this code to adapt the comboBox Items:

  ```C#
  private void comboBox1_SelectionChangeCommitted(object sender, EventArgs e)
  {
      if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(comboBox1.SelectedValue.ToString()))
      {
          SetComboBoxItemsLanguage(comboBox1.SelectedValue.ToString());
      }
      else
      {
          SetComboBoxItemsLanguage("en-US");
      }
  }
  ```

  Now, the Form runs, and when the Language is changes, the language list in the ComboBox changes also:

  !["combo EN"](/media/110_comboBox_EN.png) !["Combo FR"](/media/120_comboBox_FR.png)
